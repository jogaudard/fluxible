# fluxible 1.1.1

* `flux_gep`: deprecated, renamed into `flux_gpp` (does exactly the same).
* Fixed equations in documentation.

# fluxible 1.1.0

# fluxible 1.0.5

* `flux_quality`: fluxes with bad fit are now flagged as zero if their linear slope is below the minimal detectable slope (calculated as $2 \times \text{instrument error} / \text{length of flux}$) instead of discard.

# fluxible 1.0.4

* `flux_fitting`:
  - `exp_hm` to use the HM model (Pedersen et al., 2010; Hutchinson and Mosier, 1981).
  - returns the linear slope besides the chosen method.
* `flux_quality`: 
  - `kappamax = TRUE` to apply the kappamax method (HÃ¼ppi et al., 2018) on any of the exponential fits.
  - g-factor in the output shows the ratio of slope over the linear slope.
  - `force_linear` and `force_exp` to force the use of the linear or exponential slope (kappamax method).
* `flux_match`: option to feed a column with the end time instead of a fixed measurement length, in case fluxes do not all have the same length
* `flux_calc`:
  - `cols_sum` columns for which the values will be summed for each flux.
  - `cols_med` columns for which the median will be provided for each flux.

# fluxible 1.0.3

* `stupeflux`: a wrap function to directly process raw gas concentration data into ecosystem gas fluxes.
* `flux_fitting`: if `optim` returns non-finite values, the slope is NA and the function does not crash anymore.
* `flux_fitting`: new model `exp_tz`. Same as `exp_zhao18` except the user defines `t_zero`.

# fluxible 1.0.2

* `flux_gep`: fluxes presents in the dataset that are neither NEE nor ER (soilR, LRC or other) are not lost anymore.

# fluxible 1.0.1

* `flux_quality`: added `force_zero` argument to force a flux to be replaced by zero.

# fluxible 0.1.3

* Error corrected in `flux_gep`: the columns in the `cols_keep` argument are
  filled for GEP flux with values from NEE flux, and NA if missing,
  but not values from ER fluxes.

# fluxible 0.1.2

* `flux_gep` allows to keep all columns without naming them.
* Order of columns in the output of flux_match is more logical
  (f_start before f_end...).

# fluxible 0.1.1

* Vignettes temporarily back in Rmd until quarto_render bug is fixed
  (https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/2830)

# fluxible 0.1.0

* Added a vignette describing how to prepare the data for `fluxible`.
* `flux_plot` now adds a vertical line showing where t_zero is.
* 'flux_plot': scale_x_datetime arguments are now past as a list.
* Functions now recycle user's column names instead of renaming them.
  Columns created by fluxible functions have the suffix 'f_'.

# fluxible 0.0.6

* Correction in `flux_quality`: 'zero' and 'discard' flags were inverted when
  using the linear fit.

# fluxible 0.0.5

* `flux_plot`: fixed the blurriness of quality flags.

# fluxible 0.0.4

* `flux_gep` function to calculate GEP.

# fluxible 0.0.3

* All plots are colored the same (colors code for raw concentration data points
  and fit and slope in black).
* Legend for line types in plots.
* Plot subtitles indicating the fit type.

# fluxible 0.0.2

* `flux_calc` allows to choose units.
* `flux_calc` alows plot area as a variable.
* `flux_fitting` with exponential model works when concentration data are
  missing in the middle of the measurement.
