Description: Processes the raw data from closed loop flux chamber (or tent)
    setups into ecosystem gas fluxes usable for analysis. It goes from a
    data frame of gas concentration over time (which can contain several
    measurements) and a meta data file indicating which measurement was done
    when, to a data frame of ecosystem gas fluxes including quality diagnostics.
    Functions provided include different models (exponential as described in
    Zhao et al (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.08.022>, quadratic and
    linear) to estimate the fluxes from the raw data, quality assessment,
    plotting for visual check and calculation of fluxes based on the setup
    specific parameters (chamber size, plot area, ...).
