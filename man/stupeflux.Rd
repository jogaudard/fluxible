\item{raw_conc}{dataframe of CO2 concentration measured continuously.
Has to contain at least a datetime column in ymd_hms format and
a gas concentration column as double.}

\item{fit_type}{\code{exp_zhao18}, \code{exp_tz}, \code{exp_hm}, \code{quadratic} or \code{linear.}
\code{exp_zhao18} is using the exponential model
\ifelse{html}{\out{C(t) = C_m + a (t - t_z) + (C_z - C_m) exp(-b (t - t_z))}}
{\eqn{C(t) = C_m + a (t - t_z) + (C_z - C_m) \exp(-b (t - t_z))}{ASCII}}
from Zhao et al (2018).
\code{expt_tz} is a modified version which allows the user to fix \code{t_zero}:
\ifelse{html}{\out{C(t) = C_m + a * t + (C_z - C_m) exp(-b * t)}}
{\eqn{C(t) = C_m + a * t + (C_z - C_m) \exp(-b * t)}{ASCII}}
\code{exp_hm} is using the HM model
(Pedersen et al., 2010; Hutchinson and Mosier, 1981)
\ifelse{html}{\out{C(t) = C_m + (C_z - C_m) exp(-b * t)}}
{\eqn{C(t) = C_m + (C_z - C_m) \exp(-b * t)}{ASCII}}}

\item{temp_air_col}{column containing the air temperature used
to calculate fluxes. Will be averaged with NA removed.}

\item{chamber_volume}{volume of the flux chamber in L,
can also be a column in case it is a variable}

\item{atm_pressure}{atmospheric pressure,
can be a constant (numerical) or a variable (column name)}

\item{plot_area}{area of the plot in m^2,
can also be a column in case it is a variable}

\item{conc_unit}{unit in which the concentration of gas was measured
\code{ppm} or \code{ppb}}

\item{flux_unit}{unit in which the calculated flux will be
\code{mmol} outputs fluxes in
\ifelse{html}{\out{mmol * m<sup>-2</sup> * h<sup>-1</sup>}}
{\eqn{mmol*m^{-2}*h^{-1}}{ASCII}};
\code{micromol} outputs fluxes in
\ifelse{html}{\out{micromol * m<sup>-2</sup> * h<sup>-1</sup>}}
{\eqn{micromol*m^{-2}*h^{-1}}{ASCII}}}

\item{fixed_length}{if \code{TRUE} (default), the \code{measurement_length} is used to
create the end column. If \code{FALSE}, \code{end_col} has to be provided.}

\item{cols_keep}{columns to keep from the input to the output.
Those columns need to have unique values for each flux,
as distinct() is applied.}

\item{cols_ave}{columns with values that should be averaged
for each flux in the output. Note that NA are removed in mean calculation.}

\item{cols_sum}{columns with values for which is sum is provided
for each flux in the output. Note that NA are removed in sum calculation.}

\item{cols_med}{columns with values for which is median is provided
for each flux in the output. Note that NA are removed in median calculation.}

\item{tube_volume}{volume of the tubing in L,
can also be a column in case it is a variable}

\item{ratio_threshold}{ratio of gas concentration data points over length of
measurement (in seconds) below which the measurement will be considered as
not having enough data points to be considered for calculations}

\item{time_diff}{time difference (in seconds) between the two datasets.
Will be added to the datetime column of the raw_conc dataset.
For situations where the time was not synchronized correctly.}

\item{start_cut}{time to discard at the start of the measurements
(in seconds)}

\item{end_cut}{time to discard at the end of the measurements (in seconds)}

\item{cz_window}{window used to calculate Cz, at the beginning of cut window
(exponential fit)}

\item{b_window}{window to estimate b. It is an interval after tz where
it is assumed that the model fits the data perfectly (exponential fit)}

\item{a_window}{window at the end of the flux to estimate a (exponential fit)}

\item{roll_width}{width of the rolling mean for CO2 when looking for tz,
ideally same as cz_window (exponential fit)}

\item{t_zero}{time at which the slope should be calculated
(for \code{quadratic} and \code{exp_tz} fits)}

\item{force_discard}{vector of fluxIDs that should be discarded
by the user's decision}

\item{force_ok}{vector of fluxIDs for which the user wants to keep
the calculated slope despite a bad quality flag}

\item{force_zero}{vector of fluxIDs that should be replaced by zero by
the user's decision}

\item{ambient_conc}{ambient gas concentration in ppm at the site of
measurement (used to detect measurement that started with a polluted setup)}

\item{error}{error of the setup, defines a window outside of which
the starting values indicate a polluted setup}

\item{pvalue_threshold}{threshold of p-value below which the change of
gas concentration over time is considered not significant
(linear and quadratic fit)}

\item{rsquared_threshold}{threshold of r squared value below which
the linear model is considered an unsatisfactory fit
(linear and quadratic fit)}

\item{rmse_threshold}{threshold for the RMSE of each flux above which
the fit is considered unsatisfactory (exponential fit)}

\item{cor_threshold}{threshold for the correlation coefficient of
gas concentration with time below which the correlation
is considered not significant (exponential fit)}

\item{b_threshold}{threshold for the b parameter.
Defines a window with its opposite inside which the fit is
considered good enough (exponential fit)}

\item{temp_air_unit}{units in which air temperature was measured.
Has to be either \code{celsius} (default), \code{fahrenheit} or \code{kelvin.}}

\item{cut}{if 'TRUE' (default), the measurements will be cut according to
'f_cut' before calculating fluxes. This has no influence on the flux itself
since the slope is provided from \link[fluxible:flux_fitting]{flux_fitting},
but it will influence the values of the columns in \code{cols_ave}.}

\item{slope_correction}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, the flux will be calculated with
the slope corrected according to the recommandations of the quality flags.}
}
