\value{
a dataframe with added columns of quality flags (\code{f_quality_flag}),
the slope corrected according to the quality flags (\code{f_slope_corr}),
and any columns present in the input.
It will also print a summary of the quality flags. This summary can also
be exported as a dataframe using
\link[fluxible:flux_flag_count]{flux_flag_count}
}
\description{
Indicates if the slopes provided by
\link[fluxible:flux_fitting]{flux_fitting} should be discarded or replaced
by 0 according to quality thresholds set by user
}
\details{
the kappamax method (Hüppi et al., 2018) selects the linear slope if
\ifelse{html}{\out{|b| > kappamax}}
{\eqn{|b| > kappamax}{ASCII}}, with
\ifelse{html}{\out{kappamax = |f_slope_lm / instr_error|}}
{\eqn{kappamax = |f_slope_lm / instr_error|}{ASCII}}.
The original kappamax method was applied to the HMR model
(Pedersen et al., 2010; Hutchinson and Mosier, 1981), but here it can be
applied to any exponential fit.
