\title{Fitting a model to the gas concentration curve and estimating the slope
over time, using the exponential model from Zhao et al (2018)}
\usage{
flux_fitting_exp(
  conc_df,
  t_window,
  cz_window,
  b_window,
  a_window,
  roll_width,
  start_cut,
  end_cut,
  start_col,
  end_col,
  datetime_col,
  conc_col,
  fluxid_col
)
}
\arguments{
\item{conc_df}{dataframe of gas concentration over time}

\item{t_window}{enlarge focus window before and after tmin and tmax}

\item{cz_window}{window used to calculate Cz, at the beginning of cut window}

\item{b_window}{window to estimate b. It is an interval after tz
where it is assumed that C fits the data perfectly}

\item{a_window}{window at the end of the flux to estimate a}

\item{roll_width}{width of the rolling mean for CO2 when looking for tz,
ideally same as cz_window}

\item{start_cut}{time to discard at the start of the measurements
(in seconds)}

\item{end_cut}{time to discard at the end of the measurements (in seconds)}

\item{start_col}{column with datetime when the measurement started}

\item{end_col}{column with datetime when the measurement ended}

\item{datetime_col}{column with datetime of each concentration measurement}

\item{conc_col}{column with gas concentration data}

\item{fluxid_col}{column with ID of each flux}
}
\value{
a dataframe with the slope at t zero,
modeled concentration over time and exponential expression parameters
}
\description{
Fits an exponential expression to the concentration evolution
