\arguments{
\item{conc_df}{dataframe of gas concentration over time}

\item{start_cut}{time to discard at the start of the measurements
(in seconds)}

\item{end_cut}{time to discard at the end of the measurements (in seconds)}

\item{start_col}{column with datetime when the measurement started}

\item{end_col}{column with datetime when the measurement ended}

\item{datetime_col}{column with datetime of each concentration measurement
Note that if there are duplicated datetime in the same f_fluxID only
the first row will be kept}

\item{conc_col}{column with gas concentration data}

\item{fluxid_col}{column with ID of each flux}

\item{t_window}{enlarge focus window before and after tmin and tmax
(exponential fit)}

\item{cz_window}{window used to calculate Cz, at the beginning of cut window
(exponential fit)}

\item{b_window}{window to estimate b. It is an interval after tz where
it is assumed that the model fits the data perfectly (exponential fit)}

\item{a_window}{window at the end of the flux to estimate a (exponential fit)}

\item{roll_width}{width of the rolling mean for CO2 when looking for tz,
ideally same as cz_window (exponential fit)}

\item{t_zero}{time at which the slope should be calculated
(for quadratic fit)}

\item{fit_type}{exponential, quadratic or linear.
Exponential is using the exponential model from Zhao et al (2018)}
}
\value{
a dataframe with the slope at t zero,
and parameters of a model of gas concentration over time
}
\description{
fits gas concentration over time data with a model
(exponential, quadratic or linear) and provides the slope later used
to calculate gas fluxes with flux_calc
}
\examples{
data(co2_conc)
flux_fitting(co2_conc, fit_type = "exp")
flux_fitting(co2_conc, fit_type = "quadratic", t_zero = 10, end_cut = 30)
}
