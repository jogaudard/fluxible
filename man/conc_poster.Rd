\title{CO2 concnetration}
\format{
A tibble with 530 rows and 11 variables
\describe{
\item{datetime}{Datetime at which CO2 concentration was recorded.}
\item{f_conc}{CO2 concentration in ppm.}
\item{f_start}{Datetime at which the measurement was started.}
\item{f_fluxID}{Unique ID for each flux.}
\item{f_cut}{Indicating if the measurement should be kept (keep) or
discarded (cut).}
\item{f_b}{b parameter of the C(t) function, calculated by optim() with
b_est as starting point.}
\item{f_fit}{C(t), modeled CO2 concentration as a function of time.}
\item{fit_slope}{Output of linear model of CO2 concentration passing by
C(tz) and a slope of slope_tz.}
\item{f_cor_coef}{coefficient of correlation between gas concentration
and time}
\item{f_RMSE}{RMSE of the exponential fit and the measured data}
\item{f_quality_flag}{quality flag advising if the slope has to be
replaced by 0 or NA}
