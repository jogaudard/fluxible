\usage{
flux_flag_count(
  slopes_df,
  f_flags = c("ok", "discard", "zero", "force_discard", "start_error", "no_data",
    "force_ok"),
  fluxid_col = "f_fluxID",
  flags_col = "f_quality_flag",
  cut_col = "f_cut",
  cut_arg = "cut"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{slopes_df}{dataframe of flux slopes}

\item{f_flags}{list of flags used in the dataset
(if different from default from flux_quality).
If not provided, it will list only the flags that are
present in the dataset (no showing 0).}

\item{fluxid_col}{column containing fluxes unique ID}

\item{flags_col}{column containing the quality flags}

\item{cut_col}{column indicating which part of the flux is being cut}

\item{cut_arg}{argument defining that the data point should be cut out}
}
\value{
a dataframe with the number of fluxes for each quality flags
and their proportion to the total
}
\description{
provides a table of how many fluxes were attributed
which quality flag.
This function is incorporated in flux_quality (output as a message)
but can be used alone to extract a dataframe with the flag count.
