\usage{
flux_flag_count(
  slopes_df,
  f_fluxid = f_fluxid,
  f_quality_flag = f_quality_flag,
  f_cut = f_cut,
  f_flags = c("ok", "discard", "zero", "force_discard", "start_error", "no_data",
    "force_ok", "force_zero", "force_lm"),
  cut_arg = "cut"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{slopes_df}{dataframe of flux slopes}

\item{f_fluxid}{column containing fluxes unique ID}

\item{f_quality_flag}{column containing the quality flags}

\item{f_cut}{column indicating which part of the flux is being cut}

\item{f_flags}{list of flags used in the dataset
(if different from default from flux_quality).
If not provided, it will list only the flags that are
present in the dataset (no showing 0).}

\item{cut_arg}{argument defining that the data point should be cut out}
}
\value{
a dataframe with the number of fluxes for each quality flags
and their proportion to the total
}
\description{
Provides a table of how many fluxes were attributed
which quality flag. This function is incorporated in
\link[fluxible]{flux_quality} as a message, but can be used alone to extract
a dataframe with the flag count.
}
\examples{
data(co2_conc)
slopes <- flux_fitting(co2_conc, conc, datetime, fit_type = "exp_zhao18")
slopes_flag <- flux_quality(slopes, conc)
flux_flag_count(slopes_flag)
