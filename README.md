<!-- badges: end --> The Fluxible R package is made to transform any
dataset of gas concentration over time into a gas flux dataset. It was
originally made to be used with a closed loop chamber system connected
to a gas analyzer.

The goal of fluxible is to provide a workflow that removes individual
evaluation of each flux, reduces risk of bias, and makes it
reproducible. Users set specific data quality standards and selection
parameters as function arguments that are applied to the entire dataset.
The package runs the calculations automatically, without prompting the
user to take decisions mid-way, and provides quality flags and plots at
the end of the process for a visual check. This makes it easy to use
with large flux datasets and to integrate into a reproducible workflow.
Using the Fluxible R package makes the workflow reproducible, increases
compatibility across studies, and is more time efficient.

## Installation

Fluxible can be installed from CRAN.

``` r
install.packages("fluxible")
```

You can install the development version of fluxible from the [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/Plant-Functional-Trait-Course/fluxible) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("plant-functional-trait-course/fluxible")
```

## Short example

``` r
library(fluxible)

conc_df <- flux_match(
  co2_df_short,
  record_short,
  datetime,
  start,
  conc,
  startcrop = 10,
  measurement_length = 220
)

slopes_df <- flux_fitting(
  conc_df,
  conc,
  datetime,
  fit_type = "exp_zhao18",
  end_cut = 30
)
#> Cutting measurements...
#> Estimating starting parameters for optimization...
#> Optimizing fitting parameters...
#> Calculating fits and slopes...
#> Done.

slopes_flag_df <- flux_quality(
  slopes_df,
  conc

flux_plot(
  slopes_flag_df,
  conc,
  datetime,
  f_ylim_lower = 390,
  f_ylim_upper = 650,
  facet_wrap_args = list(
    ncol = 3,
    nrow = 2,
    scales = "free"
  )
)

## Further developments

### Segmentation tool

We are working on a tool to automatically select the window of the
measurement on which to fit a model. This selection will be based on
environmental variable, such as photosynthetically active radiation
(PAR), measured simultaneously.

### More fits

As we want fluxible to fit the use of as many projects as possible, more
fitting expressions will be included in the flux_fitting function. Feel
welcome to get in touch if you wish to include yours in fluxible.
