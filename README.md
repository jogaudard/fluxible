# Fluxible

**Note:** fluxible is still in an early phase, it is fully functional
but can be improved in many ways. Please get in touch for any problems
or suggestions.

The Fluxible R package is made to transform any dataset of gas
concentration over time into a gas flux dataset. It was originally made
to be used with a closed loop chamber system connected to a gas
analyzer. A function for use with a tent (taking leakage into account)
is in development (see further developments).

The goal of fluxible is to provide a workflow that removes individual
evaluation of each flux, reduces risk of bias, and makes it
reproducible. Users set specific data quality standards and selection
parameters as function arguments that are applied to the entire dataset.
The package runs the calculations automatically, without prompting the
user to take decisions mid-way, and provides quality flags and plots at
the end of the process for a visual check. This makes it easy to use
with large flux datasets and to integrate into a reproducible workflow.
Using the Fluxible R package makes the workflow reproducible, increases
compatibility across studies, and is more time efficient.

For a quick overview of how the package works, you can look at [the
poster](https://github.com/Plant-Functional-Trait-Course/fluxible/blob/main/dissemination/poster_EGU24_jgaudard.pdf)
that was presented at the European Geosciences Union Annual Meeting
2024.

## Installation

Fluxible can be installed from CRAN.

``` r
install.packages("fluxible")
```

You can install the development version of fluxible from the [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/Plant-Functional-Trait-Course/fluxible) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("plant-functional-trait-course/fluxible")
```

## Short example

``` r
library(fluxible)

conc <- flux_match(
  co2_df_short,
  record_short
)

slopes <- flux_fitting(
  conc,
  fit_type = "exp",
  end_cut = 30
)
#> Cutting measurements...
#> Estimating starting parameters for optimization...
#> Optimizing fitting parameters...
#> Calculating fits and slopes...
#> Done.

slopes_flag <- flux_quality(
  slopes
)
#> 
#>  Total number of measurements: 6
#> 
#>  ok   6   100 %
#>  discard      0   0 %
#>  zero     0   0 %
#>  force_discard   0   0 %
#>  start_error      0   0 %
#>  no_data      0   0 %
#>  force_ok     0   0 %

flux_plot(
  slopes_flag,
  f_ylim_lower = 390,
  f_ylim_upper = 650,
  facet_wrap_args = list(
    ncol = 3,
    nrow = 2,
    scales = "free"
  )
)
#> Plotting in progress

## Further developments

### Flux tent

Currently fluxible is thought for setups using a flux chamber. Flux
chambers can be assumed to have no leak. As flux tents tend to leak, a
different fitting function is needed to account for potential leaks.

### More fits

As we want fluxible to fit the use of as many projects as possible, more
fitting expressions will be included in the flux_fitting function. Feel
welcome to get in touch if you wish to include yours in fluxible.
