The Fluxible R package is made to transform any dataset of gas
concentration over time into a gas flux dataset.
<!-- It was originally made to be used with a closed loop chamber system connected to a gas analyzer. -->
Thanks to its flexibility, it works for all kinds of setups (separated
files for each measurement vs continuous logging, variable vs constant
chamber volume, variable vs constant measurement length, …). It is
organized as a toolbox with one function per steps, which offers a lot
of freedom. If environmental data were recorded simultaneously
(photosynthetically active radiation, soil temperature, …), they can
also be processed (mean, sum or median), with the same focus window as
the flux estimate.

The goal of fluxible is to provide a workflow that removes individual
evaluation of each flux, reduces risk of bias, and makes it
reproducible. Users set specific data quality standards and selection
parameters as function arguments that are applied to the entire dataset.
Fluxible offers different methods to estimate fluxes: linear, quadratic,
exponential (Zhao *et al.*, 2018), and the original HM model (Hutchinson
and Mosier, 1981; Pedersen *et al.*, 2010). The kappamax method (Hüppi
*et al.*, 2018) is also included, at the quality control step. The
package runs the calculations automatically, without prompting the user
to take decisions mid-way, and provides quality flags and plots at the
end of the process for a visual check.

This makes it easy to use with large flux datasets and to integrate into
a reproducible and automated data processing pipeline such as the
[targets R package (Landau, 2021)](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/).
Using the Fluxible R package makes the workflow reproducible, increases
compatibility across studies, and is more time efficient.

For a visual overview of the package, see [the
poster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Plant-Functional-Trait-Course/fluxible/refs/heads/main/dissemination/poster_fluxible.pdf).

## Supporting infrastructure

### licoread R package

The [licoread R
package](https://jogaudard.github.io/licoread/index.html), developped in
collaboration with [LI-COR](https://www.licor.com/), provides an easy
way to import raw files from Li-COR gas analyzers as R objects that can
be used directly with the Fluxible R package.

## Further developments

### Segmentation tool

We are working on a tool to automatically select the window of the
measurement on which to fit a model. This selection will be based on
environmental variable, such as photosynthetically active radiation
(PAR), measured simultaneously.

### More fits

As we want fluxible to fit the use of as many projects as possible, more
fitting expressions will be included in the flux_fitting function. Feel
welcome to get in touch if you wish to include yours in fluxible.
