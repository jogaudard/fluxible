<!-- badges: end -->

The Fluxible R package is made to transform any dataset of gas
concentration over time into a gas flux dataset. It was originally made
to be used with a closed loop chamber system connected to a gas
analyzer.

The goal of fluxible is to provide a workflow that removes individual
evaluation of each flux, reduces risk of bias, and makes it
reproducible. Users set specific data quality standards and selection
parameters as function arguments that are applied to the entire dataset.
Fluxible offers different methods to estimate fluxes: linear, quadratic,
exponential (Zhao *et al.*, 2018), and the original HM model (Hutchinson
and Mosier, 1981; Pedersen *et al.*, 2010). The kappamax method (Hüppi
*et al.*, 2018) is also included, at the quality control step. The
package runs the calculations automatically, without prompting the user
to take decisions mid-way, and provides quality flags and plots at the
end of the process for a visual check.

This makes it easy to use with large flux datasets and to integrate into
a reproducible and automated data processing pipeline such as the
targets R package (Landau, 2021). Using the Fluxible R package makes the
workflow reproducible, increases compatibility across studies, and is
more time efficient.

For a visual overview of the package, see [the
poster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Plant-Functional-Trait-Course/fluxible/refs/heads/main/dissemination/poster_fluxible.pdf).

## Installation

Fluxible can be installed from CRAN.

``` r
install.packages("fluxible")
```

You can install the development version of fluxible from the [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/Plant-Functional-Trait-Course/fluxible) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("plant-functional-trait-course/fluxible")
```

## Short example

``` r
library(fluxible)

  co2_df_short,

)

slopes_df <- flux_fitting(
  conc_df,
  conc,
  datetime,
  fit_type = "exp_zhao18",
  end_cut = 30
)
#> Cutting measurements...

  datetime,
  f_ylim_lower = 390,
  f_ylim_upper = 650,
  facet_wrap_args = list(

## Further developments

### The licoread R package

The
[https://jogaudard.github.io/licoread/index.html](licoread%20R%20package),
currently under development in collaboration with
[https://www.licor.com/](Li-COR), will provide an easy way to import raw
files from Li-COR gas analyzers as R objects that can be used directly
with the Fluxible package.

### Segmentation tool

We are working on a tool to automatically select the window of the
measurement on which to fit a model. This selection will be based on
environmental variable, such as photosynthetically active radiation
(PAR), measured simultaneously.

### More fits

As we want fluxible to fit the use of as many projects as possible, more
fitting expressions will be included in the flux_fitting function. Feel
welcome to get in touch if you wish to include yours in fluxible.
