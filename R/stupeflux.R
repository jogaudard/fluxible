#' From raw gas concentration over time to clean fluxes
#' @description Wrapper function for the Fluxible workflow. We recommand using
#' the step-by-step workflow for more control over the process.
#' @param raw_conc dataframe of CO2 concentration measured continuously.
#' Has to contain at least a datetime column in ymd_hms format and
#' a gas concentration column as double.
#' @param field_record dataframe recording which measurement happened when.
#' Has to contain at least a column containing the start of each measurement,
#' and any other column identifying the measurements.
#' @param startcrop how many seconds should be discarded at the beginning of
#' the measurement
#' @param measurement_length length of the measurement (in seconds)
#' from the start specified in the field_record
#' @param ratio_threshold ratio (number of concentration measurement compared to
#' length of measurement in seconds) below which the data should be flagged as
#' too little
#' @param time_diff time difference (in seconds) between the two datasets.
#' Will be added to the datetime column of the raw_conc dataset.
#' For situations where the time was not synchronized correctly.

#' create the end column. If `FALSE`, `end_col` has to be provided.
#' @param fit_type `exp_zhao18`, `exp_tz`, `exp_hm`, `quadratic` or `linear.`
#' `exp_zhao18` is using the exponential model
#' \ifelse{html}{\out{C(t) = C_m + a (t - t_z) + (C_z - C_m) exp(-b (t - t_z))}}
#' {\eqn{C(t) = C_m + a (t - t_z) + (C_z - C_m) \exp(-b (t - t_z))}{ASCII}}
#' from Zhao et al (2018).
#' `expt_tz` is a modified version which allows the user to fix `t_zero`:
#' \ifelse{html}{\out{C(t) = C_m + a * t + (C_z - C_m) exp(-b * t)}}
#' {\eqn{C(t) = C_m + a * t + (C_z - C_m) \exp(-b * t)}{ASCII}}
#' `exp_hm` is using the HM model
#' (Pedersen et al., 2010; Hutchinson and Mosier, 1981)
#' \ifelse{html}{\out{C(t) = C_m + (C_z - C_m) exp(-b * t)}}
#' {\eqn{C(t) = C_m + (C_z - C_m) \exp(-b * t)}{ASCII}}
#' @param cz_window window used to calculate Cz, at the beginning of cut window
#' (exponential fit)
#' @param b_window window to estimate b. It is an interval after tz where
#' it is assumed that the model fits the data perfectly (exponential fit)

#' @param roll_width width of the rolling mean for CO2 when looking for tz,
#' ideally same as cz_window (exponential fit)
#' @param start_cut time to discard at the start of the measurements
#' (in seconds)
#' @param end_cut time to discard at the end of the measurements (in seconds)
#' @param t_zero time at which the slope should be calculated
#' (for `quadratic` and `exp_tz` fits)
#' @param ambient_conc ambient gas concentration in ppm at the site of
#' measurement (used to detect measurement that started with a polluted setup)
#' @param error error of the setup, defines a window outside of which
#' the starting values indicate a polluted setup
#' @param force_discard vector of fluxIDs that should be discarded
#' by the user's decision
#' @param force_ok vector of fluxIDs for which the user wants to keep
#' the calculated slope despite a bad quality flag
#' @param force_zero vector of fluxIDs that should be replaced by zero by
#' the user's decision
#' @param ratio_threshold ratio of gas concentration data points over length of
#' measurement (in seconds) below which the measurement will be considered as
#' not having enough data points to be considered for calculations
#' @param pvalue_threshold threshold of p-value below which the change of
#' gas concentration over time is considered not significant
#' (linear and quadratic fit)
#' @param rsquared_threshold threshold of r squared value below which
#' the linear model is considered an unsatisfactory fit
#' (linear and quadratic fit)
#' @param rmse_threshold threshold for the RMSE of each flux above which
#' the fit is considered unsatisfactory (exponential fit)
#' @param cor_threshold threshold for the correlation coefficient of
#' gas concentration with time below which the correlation
#' is considered not significant (exponential fit)
#' @param b_threshold threshold for the b parameter.
#' Defines a window with its opposite inside which the fit is
#' considered good enough (exponential fit)
#' @param slope_correction logical. If `TRUE`, the flux will be calculated with
#' the slope corrected according to the recommandations of the quality flags.
#' @param conc_unit unit in which the concentration of gas was measured
#' `ppm` or `ppb`
#' @param flux_unit unit in which the calculated flux will be
#' `mmol` outputs fluxes in
#' \ifelse{html}{\out{mmol * m<sup>-2</sup> * h<sup>-1</sup>}}
#' {\eqn{mmol*m^{-2}*h^{-1}}{ASCII}};
#' `micromol` outputs fluxes in
#' \ifelse{html}{\out{micromol * m<sup>-2</sup> * h<sup>-1</sup>}}
#' {\eqn{micromol*m^{-2}*h^{-1}}{ASCII}}
#' @param chamber_volume volume of the flux chamber in L,
#' can also be a column in case it is a variable
#' @param tube_volume volume of the tubing in L,
#' can also be a column in case it is a variable
#' @param atm_pressure atmospheric pressure,
#' can be a constant (numerical) or a variable (column name)
#' @param plot_area area of the plot in m^2,
#' can also be a column in case it is a variable
#' @param cols_keep columns to keep from the input to the output.
#' Those columns need to have unique values for each flux,
#' as distinct() is applied.
#' @param cols_ave columns with values that should be averaged
#' for each flux in the output. Note that NA are removed in mean calculation.
#' @param cols_sum columns with values for which is sum is provided
#' for each flux in the output. Note that NA are removed in sum calculation.
#' @param cols_med columns with values for which is median is provided
#' for each flux in the output. Note that NA are removed in median calculation.
#' @param temp_air_col column containing the air temperature used
#' to calculate fluxes. Will be averaged with NA removed.
#' @param temp_air_unit units in which air temperature was measured.
#' Has to be either `celsius` (default), `fahrenheit` or `kelvin.`
#' @param cut if 'TRUE' (default), the measurements will be cut according to
#' 'f_cut' before calculating fluxes. This has no influence on the flux itself
#' since the slope is provided from \link[fluxible:flux_fitting]{flux_fitting},
#' but it will influence the values of the columns in `cols_ave`.
#' @return a dataframe containing flux IDs, datetime of measurements' starts,
#' fluxes in mmol*m^(-2)*h^(-1) or micromol*m^(-2)*h^(-1) (`f_flux`) according
#' to `flux_unit`, temperature average for each flux in Kelvin (`f_temp_ave`),
#' the total volume of the setup for each measurement (`f_volume_setup`),
#' the model used in \link[fluxible:flux_fitting]{flux_fitting},
#' any column specified in `cols_keep`, any column specified in `cols_ave` with
#' their value averaged over the measurement after cuts and discarding NA.
