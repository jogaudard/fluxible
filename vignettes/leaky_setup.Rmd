Processing concentration from a setup where leaks cannot be assumed as negligible (typically a tent for taller vegetation) requires some adjustements in the method.
In this example we present how the Fluxible package is processing such data.
The data used in this example were measured using a flux tent during the Plant Functional Trait Course (REF to data paper).

## Concept

```{r setup}
library(fluxible)
