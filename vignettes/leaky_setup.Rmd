Processing concentration from a setup where leaks cannot be assumed as negligible (typically a tent for taller vegetation) requires some adjustements in the method.
In this example we present how the Fluxible package is processing such data.
The data used in this example were measured using a flux tent during the Plant Functional Trait Course (REF to data paper).

<!-- Figure showing a typical flux with clear segments -->

## Concept
The segmentation tool looks for segments in the measurement that can be modelled linearly.
The slope of each of those segments is averaged (weighed with the length of the segments) and used to calculate the flux as usual.
Quality of fit is assessed for each of the segments similarly to the linear fit.
The difference between the segements' slope is also used as a quality check for the whole measurement.
The segmentation tool is available in the Fluxible normal workflow, as the other fitting models.

```{r setup}
library(fluxible)

str(pftc7_long)

# we need to add the end column since this dataset is not an output of flux_match
pftc7 <- pftc7_long |>
  mutate(
    f_end = start_time + 120
  )

slopes_pftc7 <- flux_fitting(
  conc_df = pftc7,
  start_cut = 0,
  end_cut = 0,
  start_col = "start_time",
  end_col = "f_end",
  datetime_col = "date_time",
  conc_col = "co2_conc",
  fluxid_col = "file_name",
  signal_strength_col = "signal_strength",
  par_col = "par",
  h2o_col = "h2o_conc",
  fit_type = "segments"
)

flags_pftc7 <- flux_quality(slopes_pftc7)

flux_plot(flags_pftc7)

flux_pftc7 <- flux_calc(flags_pftc7)
```
