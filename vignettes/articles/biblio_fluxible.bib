  abstract = {Automated transparent chambers have gained increasing popularity in recent years to continuously measure net CO2 fluxes between low-statured canopies and the atmosphere. In this study, we carried out four field campaigns with chamber measurements in a variety of mountainous grasslands. A mathematic stationary point (or critical point, a point at which the derivative of a function is zero) in the CO2 mixing ratio time series was found in a substantial fraction of the measurements at all the sites, which had a significant influence on the performances of the regression algorithms. The stationary point was probably due to condensed water on the inner wall of the chamber dome, which reduced the solar radiation and resulted in a reversal of the CO2 mixing ratio time series in the chamber (so called Clouded-Glass Effect or CGE in this study). This effect may be the cause of the observed underestimation of daytime CO2 fluxes when using common linear and exponential regression models on continuous automated chamber observations. In order to avoid biased flux estimation of daytime CO2 fluxes, we introduced a linearly increasing term to the exponential function so as to compensate for the influence of the CGE, which gives acceptable model errors and improves the CO2 flux estimation by 5\% for temperate mountainous grasslands. We conclude that exponential regression models should be favoured over linear models and recommend to account for the effects of CGE by either excluding ambiguous observations from the flux computations where stationary points can be identified in the CO2 mixing ratio time series, or by adding a linearly increasing term to the exponential regression model.},

  abstract = {Alpine grassland vegetation supports globally important biodiversity and ecosystems that are increasingly threatened by climate warming and other environmental changes. Trait-based approaches can support understanding of vegetation responses to global change drivers and consequences for ecosystem functioning. In six sites along a 1314\,m elevational gradient in Puna grasslands in the Peruvian Andes, we collected datasets on vascular plant composition, plant functional traits, biomass, ecosystem fluxes, and climate data over three years. The data were collected in the wet and dry season and from plots with different fire histories. We selected traits associated with plant resource use, growth, and life history strategies (leaf area, leaf dry/wet mass, leaf thickness, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf C, N, P content, C and N isotopes). The trait dataset contains 3,665 plant records from 145 taxa, 54,036 trait measurements (increasing the trait data coverage of the regional flora by 420\%) covering 14 traits and 121 plant taxa (ca. 40\% of which have no previous publicly available trait data) across 33 families.},

From these systems we collected 28,762 plant and leaf functional trait measurements from 76 vascular plant species, 88 leaf assimilation-temperature responses, 577 leaf handheld hyperspectral readings, 2.26 billion leaf temperature measurements, 3,696 ecosystem CO2 flux measurements, and 10.69\,ha of multispectral (10-band) and RGB cm-resolution imagery from 4,648 individual images obtained from airborne sensors. These data augment existing longer-term data on local climate, soils, plant populations, plant community composition, and ecosystem functioning from within the same experiments and study systems and from similar systems in other mountain regions globally.},

  abstract = {Most researchers agree that soil cover methods offer the most useful approach to measuring nitrous oxide (N2O) exchange in the field, but there is little uniformity in the design of covers used by them. The cover design least subject to the potential errors associated with this approach is a vented enclosure with either closed-loop air circulation or no forced air circulation. Although the soil N2O concentration gradient beneath these covers decreases with time as the gas accumulates, this problem can be overcome by a proposed change in the equation for computing flux from the increase in head-space N2O concentration. Over a broad range of sampling conditions, N2O fluxes computed from the new equation were independent of the time allowed for N2O accumulation. Other equations were developed that predict optimum soil cover vent dimensions for effectively transmitting ambient pressure fluctuations to the enclosed space while minimizing loss of the accumulating N2O by diffusion to the outside. Soil covers with vent dimensions dictated by the equations had N2O accumulation rates significantly higher than covers with 60\% smaller vent diameters but not significantly different than covers with 60\% larger vent diameters.},
